# Sona Mobile App Captues

This repository contains packet captures of the [Sona Mobile App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sona_systems.mobile)

## How it was done

* Captures were created with the [HTTP Canary App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.guoshi.httpcanary)
    * On a rooted android device to allow successful MITM decrypting ssl traffic (HTTP Canary needs to install CA certificate to system)
* Subsequently anonymized names and email addresses

## Why?!

* Students at the institute for human computer media at the University of WÃ¼rzburg have to use this tool to organise and sign up for experiments
* The platform is shared with Psychology students

These reverse engineering efforts aim to improve the experience for students of the Bachelor of human-computer-interaction

## TODO

* License
